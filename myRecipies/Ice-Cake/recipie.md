**RECIPIE**

1. Take the bottom part of the cake(**smaller*) and place the ice cream above it. Now shape it carefully to make a circle of the ice-cream **if u want to*. If u want SQUARE shape cake then- adjust the cake in square shape and place the ice-cream above it.

2. Now place some cookies above the ice cream to make the taste better. Place the other half of the cake above the cookies and add some Whipped Cream above it. Then again add some cookies above it. 

3.Take the Whipped Cream again and add it on the sides of the cake and then shape it nicely with a baking paper by wrapping it around the cake. 

*After all these steps our cake is made only thing left is freezing it. But before that... we didnt add cookies in rest of our cakes lets now move on to decoration of the cake =)*
